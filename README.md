# Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays

Software Saturdays is an event commitee hosted jointly by the Purdue University College of Engineering and the Purdue IEEE Student Branch.
It aims to teach students modern software development skils that are useful no matter what industry our attendees are in.
This spring semester, we are teaching Web App Development using ReactJS.

We also are offering 2 tracks, beginner and intermediate. Beginner starts from the basics while intermediate jumps right into ReactJS.

## Lesson Plan (Beginner)

1. Week 1 introduces HTML and CSS. We cover basic HTML layout, HTML tags, and CSS properties. **(Lesson 1)**

3. Week 3 introduces JSX and ReactJS. We cover simple JSX, adding variables to JSX, and making custom JSX components. **(Lesson 3)**
4. Week 4 introduces ReactJS props and state. We cover using props to dynamically change JSX, creating and modifing state, and adding other methods to a component. **(Lesson 4)**

## Final Project

The final project for this semester is to build a PokeDex web app using ReactJS and the free [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co).

A demo for the beginner track is here: [Coming Soon](#).

A demo for the intermediate track  is here: [Coming Soon](#).
